# ephemeral

This is the final project of Scott Anderson's Databases with Web Interfaces class.

Social anxiety is an issue that does not have the recognition or support that it deserves because it is suppressed in our desire to function and fit in in a society where conviviality and communication is favourable to the advancement of our career and interpersonal lives. The majority of social media has only exacerbated this issue, though applications like YikYak have done a wonderful job in taking into consideration the benefits of anonymity in creating a space where the focus is communal sympathy as opposed to judgement. Ephemeral explores a similar idea in which empathy and brevity are emphasized. 

Technologies include MYSQL, Java Sevlets, HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery.
